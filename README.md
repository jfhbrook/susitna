# Matanuska BASIC

Matanuska is a BASIC dialect designed for use as a shell. It asks what it would've been like if the classic 80s BASIC was better able to rise to the occasion when it came to disk features and/or competing with DOS.

Matanuska is still in development, and needs a lot of work before it's ready for regular use.

## Install

There currently aren't any installable packages for Matanuska. If you would like to try it today, follow the instructions for development.

## Development

Matanuska BASIC uses `npm` for all of its tasks. Refer to `package.json` for details.

## ADRs

Architectural decisions are documented in [./adrs](./adrs). Notes on future decisions I haven't made yet are in [./adrs/draft](./adrs/draft).

## Current Status and Next Steps

The interpreter can run "hello world" in a REPL and evaluate simple expressions. Now is time to add some basic features and button up a few gaps.

### Prioritized Backlog

- Implement JSCC pattern from telemetry to other debug functions
- for/while/goto
  - [ ] ADR for for/while/goto
- Logical operators
  - [x] Support through the parser
- Complete Print/Format syntax
  - Support ECMA-55?
  - Complete ADR
  - Print can take a channel config
- Expanded list
  - `list 10`
  - `list 10-20`
- Functions
  - [ ] ADR for functions (and maybe subroutines?)
  - Local variables
  - Closures
  - Native functions
- Path navigation - cd, ls, etc
  - `cd` is a builtin ("native function")
  - `ls` and others are on the PATH, actually
- Date/Time/Duration/TZData types
  - Core library
  - Host support
  - (Language support can come later)
- Shell commands
  - Will need to research jobs in Bash
  - Investigate alt-shells
    - [fish](https://fishshell.com/)
    - [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/)
    - [elvish](https://elv.sh/)
  - Scanner and parser support for shell commands and "shell tokens"
  - Compiler support for shell commands
  - Host support for shell commands
  - Runtime support for shell commands
  - Support \j in prompt rendering
  - (Pipes will come later)
- Shell variable export
- PS1/PS2 support
  - `SET PS1` and `SET PS2`?
  - also `HISTSIZE` and `HISTFILESIZE`
- Type-checking compiler
  - Implement type analogues to operations
  - Simulated stack in the compiler

### Up Next

- Add `tflint` and `terraform validate`
- Add trace events to parser and compiler
- Swap out `pino` for a different logger in grabthar
  - its async behavior means logs are in the wrong order
- Telemetry improvements/fixes
  - Audit/document OTEL related environment variables
  - read-eval-print appears to fire "twice"
    - No special requirements for root spans, as far as I can tell
  - No traces when running script
    - Appears that shutdown doesn't flush all traces
    - Calling forceFlush on everything doesn't seem to do the trick
    - May need to set tracer provider timeouts to 0 - see <https://github.com/jfhbrook/matanuska/blob/a325e0a045aac030222304aa621934c3727a3178/telemetry.ts>
  - Custom otel diagnostic logger
    - Note: The SDK will automatically incorporate a `DiagConsoleLogger` if you set `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL`: <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/887ff1cd6e3f795f703e40a9fbe89b3cba7e88c3/experimental/packages/opentelemetry-sdk-node/src/sdk.ts#L127-L133>
    - Also consider a `ConsoleSpanExporter`
    - They recommend "info" as a "default" - debug is too chatty
- Split matanuska into modules
  - runtime/stack/etc
  - bytecode
  - compiler
  - parser/scanner
  - errors (exceptions/faults)
  - constants
    - type stubs
    - vite configuration
  - precompiler
    - `MATBAS_BUILD` constant
    - jscc vite configuration
  - values + operations
  - host
  - shell
  - commands
- Get `npm run console` working again
  - ts-node seems to depend on a commonjs build
  - Setting `"type": "module"` in the package.json breaks commonjs completely
  - `nodenext` module resolution requires that imports end in the file extension, but vite/swc have no such requirement, and it's a bitter pill to swallow
  - ts-node _completely_ depends on tsc to do builds - making it use swc doesn't seem possible
- grabthar improvements
  - swc cli build option
  - automatically update package.json
  - lint-staged and husky support
  - `grabthar clean`
- Use [envinfo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/envinfo) in runtime fault output
- Assert module
  - Wrap 'node:assert'
  - Throw RuntimeFault
- Investigate [Node.js inspector](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/debugging)
- Escaped newlines
- Arrays
  - Including array literals - BASIC assigns each index one at a time, or uses the `data` command
  - Consider using [eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
- Implement Acey Ducey
  - `center$(n)`
  - `rnd!` (random) function
  - If/then/goto
  - functions
  - no-arguments print
  - `end` command
- Hashes
- Date/time language support
- Exception language support
- Test harness
  - `test` and `assert` commands
  - Runtime "test mode" and entrypoint subcommand
  - Reporter, possibly based off node-tap
- File I/O
- Research garbage collection
  - TypeScript is obviously garbage collected
  - But the architecture may hang onto references I don't want
- Tab-complete support in the REPL
- Starship support
- Stream/pipe support
- Break-in
  - MSX BASIC uses the `stop` and `cont` commands to control break-in behavior
  - Will need to intercept and handle ctrl-c from readline (ctrl-stop in MSX BASIC)
- Symbol dump
- Profiling
  - Line-based for users
  - Opcode-based for me
- Performance tests
  - Benchmarks
  - Profile slow benchmarks
- Editor plugins
- Generated "exceedingly large" script tests

### The Future

- Reimplement citree in Rust and [chumsky](https://docs.rs/chumsky/latest/chumsky/#example-brainfuck-parser)
- String templates
- Module system
- Package manager
- Partial rewrite in Rust and/or C/C++
- Implement entry point in Rust or C/C++
- Port to bun?
  - Nice FFI
  - Support for bundled executable
- Object support
- Vector/matrix support for 1D/2D integer/float arrays
- Assembler mini-language
- Stack trace tests robust against different node versions
